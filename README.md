# Foundry VTT Modules

This is a repository of modules for the [Foundry Virtual Tabletop](https://www.patreon.com/foundryvtt/posts).

## Installation Instructions

To install a module, follow these instructions:

1. Download the zip file included in the module directory. If one is not provided, the module is still in early development.
2. Extract the included folder to `public/modules` in your Foundry Virtual Tabletop installation folder.
3. Restart Foundry Virtual Tabletop. 

## How to use

To use this, you'll notice an `export` button next to the `close` icon when viewing a compendium, this'll download a specific `.json` file.

That .json file can then be uploaded, shared, etc and then imported by going to create a new compendium, and clicking the new `import compendium` buttons.
